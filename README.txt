Render Presets
==============
LightWave Layout LScript by Johan Steen.


Description
===========
Render Presets is a plugin for LightWave 3D that I wrote some time
ago when I worked with a project that had me switching between a
couple of different rendering settings for the same scenes over and
over again. I continued to find it useful and it has evolved over
time to include more and more settings, so I decided to clean up the
GUI a bit and make it more generic so I could release it in public.

Render Presets let’s you manage a library of different common
rendering related settings to quickly organize, apply or switch
between them.


Usage
=====
See http://www.artstorm.net/plugins/render-presets/ for usage instructions.


Installation
============
* Copy JS_RenderPresets.lsc and JS_RenderPresetsBtn.lsc to LightWave’s
  plug-in folder.
* If "Autoscan Plugins"
 is enabled, just restart LightWave and it's installed.

* Else, locate the “Add Plugins” button in LightWave and add them manually.

I’d recommend to add the plugin to a convenient spot in LightWave’s menu,
so all you have to do is press the Render Presets button when you need to
use it.


Compability
===========
Render Presets has been tested with LightWave 3D 9.6, Win32 and Win64.
As far as I know it should also work fine on the Mac.
